"""The pipeline state list's compute records: the compute programs play dispatched, named by their compute stage's code key in a
version 2 record of kind kCompute (vk_draw.cpp StateRec2), in the same lists, with the same tools, as the pipelines.

- nx2/pipeline_states.py: the record's layout, what describe and the merge make of it (each program once, with version 1 lists
  too), the checks (a compute record that holds more than its key, a kind no build knows, more compute programs than the release's check
  allows: it stops and says so, nothing is dropped), the tour's and a contributed source, and nx2/make_game.py shipping them beside the game;
- a list someone sent (add, --check): taken only when it is exactly a list. Refused, and nothing written: one cut short, one with
  a kind no build knows or a compute record that holds more than its key, one that names more compute programs than the
  game has, one larger than a list is (as a file, or once unpacked), an xz file cut short or with more after it, a list of
  another version. A list from before the kinds, and a version 1 one, are taken as they were;
- the game's own code, cut out of vk_draw.cpp and compiled with stubs for the folder: state_record_compute writes each program
  once (and once over two runs); state_list_read gives the pipelines alone, state_list_computes the programs alone; a list
  from before the kinds, and a version 1 one, read as they did; a build from before the kinds drops a compute record (targets_ok);
  computes_plan keeps ready the shipped list's and the learned ones (hookshot_computes.bin), each once, whatever is missing
  or damaged, and every one a shipped list names however many; on a first start, with nothing learned, every kept program
  as before (the shipped list's alone with RX_VK_PRECOMPILE_COMPUTES=listed); =learned / all / none;
- a list the game wrote reads in the tool and one the tool wrote reads in the game;
- precompile_run takes its compute programs from that plan, and only dispatch() records one;
- its compute arm, cut out and run against a made-up driver: a pipeline the caches hold is asked for and counted as cached, one
  they lack is compiled and counted so, one the driver refuses is not kept, and a driver that cannot say makes each with one call.
Synthetic data only. python -I -B tests/test_pipeline_state_computes.py [--cxx <compiler>]
